   rule in the store (seeded from mockRules). This is the guard that would have
   caught the original dangling-refId bug (audit records pointing at rules that
   don't exist). It runs once in dev on boot and logs loudly — it never throws,
   so it can't break the app; it just makes drift impossible to miss.
